colorscale for scatterplots must be: 
    discrete for categorical labels
    continuous for continuous lables

creating a dataframe in '*V2' (and some other) methods is repetitive.

sample only 1000 rows from dataframe

scatter plots may require '2 in a row' layout

encode variables with color(categorical) and size(numerical)
for proper encoding, follow data visualization heuristics

change the layout to have horizontal scrolling

determine categorical and continuous columns by
plotting a bar chart of column names with their count
of unique values

determine which columns need to change their dtype from 
string to float by picking 10 random samples from that
column and trying to parse it as float (float(value)).
If the majority of them get converted to float then the 
dtype may be converted to float.
eg: a numeric column might have a '?' instead of np.nan
